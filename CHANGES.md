TODO

- getInitialValue
- getAllErrors
- investigate arrays
- remove old key selector, in favour of strings-only
- add test to verify initialValue on useForm prevails over initialValue on useInput
- Define what happens when a field gets unmounted: Is it saved? validators still apply? is it removed?
